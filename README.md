# About

A quick weekend project for Jett Foundation's one month event.

This is a simple tile based gallery consisting of pictures fetched from an external api. This site is no longer live, as the compaign is ended, but I've decided to open source the code anyway.

I wanted to keep it as lightweight as possible and avoid front-end frameworks, as the scope didn't really require anything so heavy.

# Involved libraries/technologies

## Front-end
* Bootstrap (For quick css layouts)
* Jquery (For easier interaction with the dom)
* Packery (For pinterest tile/grid layout)

## Backend
* NJWT (For JWT usage with node)
* Express

Gulp was used for minification, but not much is done except for uglification/minification

The api was provided by ICUC and required JWT authentication.
